# Patterns in Python
The following Python programs use ```for loop, while loop, and range()``` function to display various patterns.
I will begin with the simplest of patterns,then intermediate level and finally trying to solve the complex of patterns
### The following are the steps to be followed while printing patterns::
* Decide the number of rows and columns
* Iterate rows
* Iterate columns
* Print the pattern i.e star or chars
* Add a new line after each iteration of outer loop. Add a new line using the ```print()``` function after each
iteration of the outer loop so that the pattern displays appropriately
